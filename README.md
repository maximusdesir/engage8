# Engage Eight

> A pre-snap prediction and defensive tendency engine for football.

Engage Eight ingests play-by-play data and answers the two questions a defensive
coordinator asks before every snap:

1. **What is the offense most likely to do?** A calibrated run/pass and explosive
   probability (plus a play-leaning), given down, distance, field position, score,
   time, and formation or personnel when available.
2. **What are their tendencies?** A tendency matrix sliced by down and distance,
   field zone, formation, and hash, so you can self-scout or scout an opponent.

It trains on free, open nflverse NFL play-by-play, and also lets you chart a real
opponent by hand so it works for teams that aren't in public datasets.

## Why I built this

I grew up watching Luke Kuechly, Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Ray Lewis. What
truly set them apart wasn't athleticism, it was football IQ. Diagnosing what the
offense or defense was going to do before the snap let them play faster and make
plays no one else could.

I play football too, and as a defensive player I've learned how much scout film
matters and how slow it is to watch. I wanted a tool that could speed up film
study and let me quiz myself on my own pre-snap reads.

I believe AI can change football, and I wanted to build something that starts to
show how, even with almost no resources. Now imagine what a team with millions in
budget could do.

## A note on accuracy

Run/pass prediction from the situation lands around 72 to 75 percent. Predicting a
specific play family from public data is much harder (roughly 30 to 45 percent
top-1). The model reports its calibration (Brier score), not just accuracy, and is
validated with time-based splits: train on past seasons, test on the most recent.
A random split would leak the future and inflate the results.

## Project status

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Data + ML pipeline (`ml/`) | Working end-to-end on real NFL data |
| API (`api/`) | Planned |
| Web app (`web/`) | Planned |
| Hudl CSV import | Working (breakdown export to plays) |

### Measured results (run/pass, 2019-2023)

Trained on 173,881 real run/pass plays from nflverse, with a time-split: train on
2019-2021, calibrate on 2022, test on the fully held-out 2023 season.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test-season accuracy | 69.7% |
| Naive baseline (always guess majority) | 59.0% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.766 |
| Brier score (lower is better-calibrated) | 0.192 |

The model's top signals are exactly what a coordinator reads: offense identity,
time remaining, field position, score differential, and down and distance. For
example, it calls 89% pass on 3rd-and-8 and 85% run on 3rd-and-1 at the 2-yard
line.

## Quickstart (ML pipeline)

```bash
cd ml
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Python 3.11 or 3.12
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Pull nflverse play-by-play (downloads to ml/data/)
python -m engage8.extract --seasons 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023

# 2. Normalize to the canonical schema and engineer features
python -m engage8.features

# 3. Train the run/pass model (time-split, calibrated)
python -m engage8.train

# 4. Predict a situation
python -m engage8.predict --down 2 --distance 6 --yardline 38 \
    --quarter 2 --clock 252 --score-diff 3
```

## Data sources

- **nflverse / nflfastR** ([github.com/nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse)):
  open NFL play-by-play with EPA and win probability. The pipeline downloads the
  published season parquet files directly, so there's no extra loader dependency.
- **Manual charting**: chart any team's plays into a CSV and run the same tendency
  and prediction engine on them.
